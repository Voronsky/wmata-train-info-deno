# wmata-train-info-deno
A simple backend that interfaces with Washington DC's transit systems, "WMATA", API. The only reason I made this, was so that I can make the calls a bit easier for whenever I get around to plugging this into a tidByte.

## Env files
Intentionally ommitteed, make sure it contains a key 

```
API_KEY=<api_key>
TOKEN_SECRET=<secret_token_key>
```

## TODO

Todo: 
- [ ] Integrate into a db for storing user jwts
- [ ] integrate into tidbyte for funsies
